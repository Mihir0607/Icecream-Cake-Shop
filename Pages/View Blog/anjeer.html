            churned to perfection using Naturals’ signature three-ingredient recipe, ensuring a rich, creamy texture and

        <p class="anjeer-parah"><B>Anjeer Kaju Ice Cream</B></p>

        <p class="anjeer-parag">Enough to make one go nuts, this regal ice cream boasts royalty. It combines crunchy
            roasted cashew nuts
            with the soft, juicy, and fleshy texture of dry anjeer (figs) from Afghanistan, resulting in a flavour
            that’s not only tempting but also velvety-smooth in consistency. In fact, the combination of figs and
            cashews, create perfect harmony, offering a taste experience that is both rich and refreshing.

        <p class="anjeer-parah"><b>Seasonal delight</b></p>

        <p class="anjeer-paragr">Custard apples are typically harvested between September and December, which means this
            ice cream is available for a limited time each year. This seasonal nature adds to the allure, making it a
            must-try treat during its availability. The anticipation of waiting for this flavour makes it even more
            special, much like waiting for mangoes in the summer.</p> <br><br>
